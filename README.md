#Parallel-Volume-Rendering-using-MPI

Engineered parallel volume rendering using MPICH, optimizing 1D/2D domain decomposition for faster processing • Implemented front-back ray casting with early termination, 
reducing execution time by 15% on Windows systems • Optimized performance by fine-tuning step size and process distribution by parallelization to stitch partial images
